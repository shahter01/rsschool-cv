# About Me

I am 20 years old, I study at the 4th year of BNTU at the Faculty of Mining and Engineering Ecology. At some point in my studies I realized that I no longer liked my chosen specialty. I chose the IT sphere, as I need an activity in which I could develop throughout my life. Considering a lot of IT directions, I decided to stop on WEB development, one of the most popular directions. Learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, I found out about the free RS School. My goal is to get knowledge in the field of front-end development.

# Skills

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Basic)
* Git/GitHub

# Code Example

```JavaScript
function evenOrOdd(number) {
  if (number % 2 === 0){
    return "Even";
  } else {
    return "Odd";
  }
} 
```
